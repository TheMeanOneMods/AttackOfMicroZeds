# AttackOfMicroZeds

The Story: How It Began with a Rogue ScientistYou woke up to an eerie silence. The usual groans and shuffles of the undead were absent, replaced by an unsettling, high-pitched screeching. As you stumbled out of your shelter, the world seemed distorted. That’s when you saw them—zombies, but not as you remembered. They were smaller, faster, and far more cunning. Their movements were erratic and their relentless assaults broke through even the most fortified defenses, turning strongholds into death traps.
Rumors spread quickly among survivors. A rogue scientist, desperate to end the apocalypse, had unleashed an experimental pathogen—a virus designed to shrink the undead, making them more manageable. But something went horribly wrong. The virus didn’t weaken them; it amplified their aggression, resilience, and speed. Now, these micro abominations are the ultimate predators, overwhelming survivors with their sheer numbers and unrelenting ferocity. The apocalypse just got a whole lot smaller...and deadlier.
